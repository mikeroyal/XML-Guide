[XML(Extensible Markup Language)](https://www.w3.org/XML/) is a markup language that is similar to HTML but without predefined tags. Instead, the user define their own tags designed specifically for their needs. 

[XAML](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/fundamentals/xaml) is a declarative XML-based markup language that is applied to the .NET Core programming model, which XAML simplifies creating a UI for a [.NET Core app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/xaml-overview).

# XML Tools and Frameworks

[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft; which is a feature-rich application that can be used for many aspects of software development. Visual Studio makes it easy to edit, debug, build, and publish your app. By using Microsoft software development platforms such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, and Windows Store.

[MSBuild](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild) is the build platform for .NET and Visual Studio. MSBuild, provides an XML schema for a project file that controls how the build platform processes and builds software. Visual Studio uses MSBuild to perform team builds through Azure DevOps Server, but MSBuild can run without Visual Studio.

[WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) is a professional IDE for JavaScript(including support for both HTML and CSS) developed by JetBrains. WebStorm comes with intelligent code completion, on-the-fly error detection, powerful navigation and refactoring for JavaScript, TypeScript, stylesheet languages, and all the most popular frameworks([Angular](https://angular.io/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/), [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/#!), and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)).
